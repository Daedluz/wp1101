# Homework 5

The calculator I impersonate is the windows built-in calculator.

## Usage

- Click the number buttons to enter numbers, the maximum length of the inputed number is 15 digits.
- You can use arithmetic operators, but if you click two operators in a row, it'll take the last one you clicked as input.
- Sorry I'm bad so the calculator won't do PEMDAS
- The calculation process will start only after you clicked the equal sign
- The base of the log function is 10, and for the log operator, once you click it, it'll return the log value of the number you currently entered.
- For memory, there's only one (I'm sorry), click `M+` to add current value to memory, click `MR` to call memory, click `MC` to clean memory.
