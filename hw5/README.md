# Homework 5

The calculator I impersonate is the windows built-in calculator.

If you clicked the wrong arithmetic button (รท, ร, -, +), you can click again to correct it.
If you click equal immediately after clicking an arithmetic operator, nothing will happen.
The base of the log function is 10. 
For the memory functions, sorry that I only offer one memory.
Oh and the calculator won't do PEMDAS.
