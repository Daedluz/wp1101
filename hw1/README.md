The image I tried to copy is [ref.jpg](ref.jpg)  
I put a menu bar to the left side  

If you hover your mouse over the menu and the preview pictures it'll change color as a prompt that you can click it.
The blue word on the menu means that this is the album you're currently watching.

The menu will hide if the window width is smaller than 1300 pixels.
